Dataset for figures of paper

The Data/Stats folder contains a R script and R workspace that can be loaded into either R or RStudio.
In order to reconstruct statistical analysis just run the R script.

The Plots folder contains four Jupyter notebooks, one for each main figure, and the neccessary data files used by them.
Re-running the Jupyter notebooks will require Jupyter/JupyterLab and the relevant libraries downloaded via Anaconda or pip3
